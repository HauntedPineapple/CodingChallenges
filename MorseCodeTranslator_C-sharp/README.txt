MORSE CODE TRANSLATOR
========================================================
Task: Write two functions, one that takes in a string of morse code and translates it into the English alphabet and one that does the opposite. 
For the input, each word in morse should be distinguished by a single space and each letter in morse should be distinguished by a forward slash, “/” with spaces on either side of it.

Examples: 
	morseToEnglish(“.... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..”) ➞ “Hello world”
	englishToMorse(“I love code”) ➞ ” .. / .-.. --- ...- . / -.-. --- -.. .”
